# Private Covid-19 Vaccination System (PCVS)

The Covid-19 vaccination rollout in Malaysia and most countries have been underway for a
few months. As more and more of the population have been vaccinated, private healthcare
centres have been allowed to purchase and administer vaccines, especially to patients who want
to choose the type of vaccine that they receive. However, the vaccinations that have been
administered by the private healthcare centres have to be recorded in the national vaccination
committee database. A system is required for the Private Covid-19 Vaccination System, known
as PCVS.
